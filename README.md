# About

nonky is a way to display system information or any kind of information right on your desktop.
Inspired by Linux's conky it takes a different approch, a straight forward api exposes a lot of data, js libraries are doing the heavier calculations and finally, use HTML5 to customize the look and feel

# Costumization

Custumization is my first priority!
To make your own nonky

- fork the repo
- clone it
- run the install script
- open a new folder in /public/templates/\<your nonchaky\>
- make the power house index.html, style.css, script.js
